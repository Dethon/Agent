# Home Assistant

Home Assistant runs at `http://<host>:8123` (published on all interfaces). On first run:

1. Create the owner account through the browser onboarding flow.
2. Profile menu → **Security → Long-Lived Access Tokens** → create one.
3. Set `HOMEASSISTANT__TOKEN=...` in `DockerCompose/.env` and restart `mcp-homeassistant`.
4. For the Roborock S8: Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → **Roborock**; the vacuum appears as `vacuum.<name>`.

The agent reaches HA in-network at `http://homeassistant:8123` via `McpServerHomeAssistant`. For voice alarms/reminders it creates events on a dedicated `calendar.assistant_alarms` calendar that an HA automation bridges to the voice announce endpoint; the `home_assistant_guide` prompt (`Domain/Prompts/HomeAssistantPrompt.cs`) teaches the idiom, and the one-time `rest_command` + automation provisioning lives in the HA instance itself.

The HA VFS engine is `Domain/Tools/HomeAssistant/Vfs/*.cs`.
