    // terminal verification (a follow-up window holds the mic open beside a talking TV, so even
    // a short follow-up burst must be judged rather than passed through). The early-close check
    // keeps the skip: a capture still open at that mark is not necessarily someone speaking, and
    // judging silence as an unknown voice would reject on a foregone conclusion. Skipped (disabled
    // / too short) and Unavailable (no model, no profiles, inference failure) both mean "let the
    // capture through" — only Rejected blocks.
