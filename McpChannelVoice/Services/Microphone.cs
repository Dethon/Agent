// knows nothing about turns — a wake turn, a follow-up turn and a question the agent asks mid-turn
// each open one, and only the first two are turns. CaptureSession sits on top of this and adds the
// turn semantics; a caller that is not opening a turn holds this instead, and cannot anchor one.
//
// Closing a capture and telling the room-noise memory what it measured are one act here, so a new
// listening path cannot do the first and forget the second. A capture that only reads would let the
// memory expire on a satellite used mostly for approvals.
