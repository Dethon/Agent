// audio-stop to lean on, so the hub must decide when the speaker has finished:
// once speech has been observed, a run of trailing silence ends the utterance.
// What counts as speech vs silence is delegated to AdaptiveLevelTracker so a
// noisy room (TV, ducked music) raises the bar instead of pinning the capture
// open. A max-utterance cap bounds runaway streams; speech shorter than
// minSpeech is treated as noise and never ends the turn on its own.
