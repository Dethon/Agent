// The two calls that sit beside AddChannelServer, so a reader comparing them sees exactly what a
// channel adds.
//
// AddMcpHost is the three things every MCP server in the repo has, whatever else it does: its own
// settings available to everything it registers, a server, and an HTTP transport. AddToolServer is
// that plus the error rule, for a server that offers the agent things to call.
//
// Being a tool server and being a channel server are independent facts about a server, which is why
// these are separate calls rather than one call with a flag: a dual-role server asks for both, and
// the once-only filter means it still ends up with one.
